/* TODO:
   add verbs that take the genitive: potrzebować, zapomnieć, używać, bać się
   add wszytsky, wpoł, kilo, więcej, mniej, litr, butelka, paczka for more genitive
   bug: no repro? The woman + will be having + the hot sausage. Kobieta będzie miała kiełbasę. where's the adjective?
   add wpol, kilo, więcej, mniej, litr, butelka, paczka for more genitive
   Support pronouns as direct objects
   Allow multiple subjects
   If they pin the subject we need to disable the "include * subjects" checkboxes
   otherwise they might change it and generate an adjective for a pronoun.
   Change 'augments' to 'extends', Word should be a formatter class, not a base class.
   see notes in adj re "should move this logic into the stem method?"
   put a data shim in so we don't have to reference 'document' directly
   currentPolishSentence method is way to long and repetitive

   Prepositions:
     * reformat all the noun data? need to add inst, locative. Just get it 
       from wiktionary?
     * best way to have different sets of nouns and verbs for the different tests?
     * need to be able to write tests for pickPreposition &c.
     
    The rules are going to be:
     1) pick a preposition
     2) that limits the number of verbs
     3) pick a verb
     4) (pick direct object?)
     5) the verb determines the case and limits the valid targets
     6) pick a target and its number

    I think nouns will need to be qualified as "locations" and "non-locations".

    BUGS:
     -  "we + to return + to the house" is "Wracamy nad dom"? Should be "do domu.
        We need to link prepositions to the prepositional nouns next.   
        See the chart from accent, and my notes.
