Polish Grammar Drills
=====================

These are a couple of javascript toys I was playing with to drill myself 
learning Polish.  All the javascript is on-page. The two little push_pin png's
are also used.

* noun-adjective.html

Simple one matching singular/plural and gender of a noun to an adjective.

* noun-verb-object.html

Fancier one constructing sentences, SVO with adjectives, and present, past and
future tenses.
